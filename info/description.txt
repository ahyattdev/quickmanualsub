This tweak adds a button to AlienBlue that brings up the view where you enter in a subreddit name. The button is next to the Edit button in Alien Blue, in the same place that the list of subscribed subreddits is.  Instead of scrolling all the way to the bottom to enter in a subreddit name, you can press the button no matter where you are scrolled to. This tweak is for people who go to subreddits frequently that they are not subscribed to. For now, only the iPhone version of Alien Blue is supported, but iPad support is Comming Soonâ„¢.
